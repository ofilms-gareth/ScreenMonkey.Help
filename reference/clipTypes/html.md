# HTML

The HTML clip will render a HTML document from a file to the chosen layer. To render a live website use the [Web Browser Clip](WebBrowserClip.md).

## Create a HTML clip
A HTML clip is created from a file on disk. Either create a new HTML clip from the clip browser and choose a file from the open dialog or drag a HTML file from Windows Explorer to an empty slot. The file can contain any valid HTML with embedded CSS however images and links are not supported.

## Use a HTML clip in a show
Play the clip as normal by left-clicking to activate it. There is no live monitor for HTML file clips.

## Notes
* If the HTML file on disk is updated then the clip will not update. The updated file must be added as a new clip.

* The HTML clip does not support transparency.
