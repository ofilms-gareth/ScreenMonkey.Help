# Autocue Clip

The autocue clip implements a tele-prompter for performers or presenters to read their script from. It is commonly used at live events and in television production. The clip allows you to import, edit and then present the text on a second screen pointed towards the performer. The vertical scroll speed of the text needs to match the person reading and is controlled by a hardware device such as an X-Keys rotary controller.
